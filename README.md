# FUNNEL ANALYSIS

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Funnel_Analysis.ipynb`, which performs funnel analysis on user data to help identify conversion drop-offs and visualize user progression through defined steps. 


## PURPOSE

The notebook explores user funnel behavior, computes step-wise conversion rates, and produces visualizations to help product and growth teams identify bottlenecks and prioritize improvements.


## REQUIREMENTS

Recommended Python packages:

- python >= 3.8
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyterlab or notebook

You can install the typical dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```

## Key Features

1. Constructed an end-to-end customer funnel and performed behavior-based segmentation using funnel depth to
analyze user progression, identify conversion bottlenecks, revenue leakage, and high-intent user cohorts.

2. Simulated A/B test to assess the effectiveness of targeted strategies on downstream funnel conversion KPIs.

3. Translated analytical findings into data-driven suggestions to improve conversion efficiency and user engagement.


## KEY FINDINGS

1. Behavioral Drop-off ( 50.00% ): Exactly half of your visitors leave the homepage without viewing a product. This points to a need for better homepage engagement or more relevant traffic sources.

2. Overall Conversion Rate ( 0.14% ): Your end-to-end success rate is extremely low ( 0.14% ).

3. Behavior-based segmentation showed that High-Intent Cart Abandoners represent a critical opportunity segment. Although they did not complete purchases, these users reached advanced funnel stages and demonstrated significantly higher conversion potential compared to low-intent browsers.


## BUSINESS RECOMENDATIONS

Prioritize high-intent user cohorts for targeted treatments and continuously evaluate performance using controlled experiments. Applying this approach can improve funnel efficiency, increase customer engagement, and drive incremental revenue growth.
